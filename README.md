# Getting Started With Tree Data Structure

The tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure where data is stored in a non-linear pattern or non-linear logical pattern.

The tree consists of nodes and edges, all nodes in the tree are connected via Edges

## Why Tree Data Structure

Other linear data structures like arrays, Linked lists, Queues, and Stacks store data sequentially, In order to perform any operations in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases as the size of data increases, and it's kinda not accepted in today's fast computational world.
